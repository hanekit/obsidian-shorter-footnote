In Obsidian, repeated references are marked in the form of [num-count], which can be confused with the form [num to num].

This plugin is designed to solve this issue.

The Better Footnote plugin affects the functionality of this plugin. If you want to avoid that, please follow these steps:

1. Enable the Shorter Footnote plugin.
2. Disable the Better Footnote plugin.
3. Enable the Better Footnote plugin.

By doing this, both plugins can be used properly.
